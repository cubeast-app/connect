        <mat-panel-title>What is Cubeast Connect?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Cubeast Connect allows Cubeast to connect to Bluetooth puzzles on your computer without having to rely on the
        browser's Bluetooth capabilities. Historically Cubeast has always used the browser to connect to Bluetooth
        devices,
        but this had some issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some browsers - like Firefox or Brave - simply don't support Bluetooth and thus cannot be used with Cubeast.
        </li>
        <li>Gan cubes use Bluetooth MAC address as a part of their encryption protocol. This was problematic because Web
          Bluetooth doesn't
          support reading the MAC address of Bluetooth devices. As a result, Cubeast had to rely on users manually
          providing
          the MAC address.
        </li>
        <li>Other browsers may have limitations or bugs in their Bluetooth implementations, leading to a suboptimal user
          experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cubeast Connect solves these issues by providing Cubeast direct access to Bluetooth devices through a native
        application running on your computer.

          Cubeast?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Yes, without Connect running Cubeast will revert to using Web Bluetooth

        <mat-panel-title>Can I use Cubeast without Cubeast Connect?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Yes, you can still use Web Bluetooth if your browser supports it. Keep in mind however that your user experience
        may be worse compared to using Cubeast Connect.

        <mat-panel-title>How does Cubeast Connect work?</mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        Cubeast Connect runs as a native application on your computer. It uses native Bluetooth APIs to discover and
        connect to Bluetooth devices. It then communicates with Cubeast through a WebSocket connection, allowing
        Cubeast to send commands to the connected devices and receive data from them.
